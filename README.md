## About Me  

Hi, I’m **Jordan** - a .NET and Java Developer who first got into programming as a hobby. My programming journey began fairly young with Minecraft and in time became my choice of career path. I try to solve problems with (hopefully...) clean, efficient code and am continually pushing myself to learn new skills and frameworks.

- **Projects:** Created tools, plugins, and applications designed to automate tasks, improve workflows, and make systems more enjoyable and efficient.  
- **Passion:** Programming started as my hobby and quickly evolved to my career path. I’m always looking to challenge myself and push skills further while contributing something valuable to others.
